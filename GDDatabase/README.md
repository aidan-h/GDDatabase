# Game Design DB 
A database for any designers and journalists of games of any type and genre
with tools for personal archival.

## Motivation
I wanted to find everything written and said by multiple game developers I admire, but there isn't a centralized resource
for finding all of their work and contributions unless they gracefully and regularly update their personalized website with
RSS or Atom support.

## Out of Scope
- Game guides / strategies
- 

## Implementation

### Model
- Game Developers / Designers
- Writings
- Interviews
- Presentations
- Games
- Socials, Blog

### Scrapers
I plan to automate data collection and organization as much as possible through the use of
crawlers and scrapers, specifically on game development blogs, social media, and distribution
platforms.
